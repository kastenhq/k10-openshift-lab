# Kasten by Veeam and Red Hat OpenShift Demo

Welcome to the **Kasten by Veeam and Red Hat OpenShift Demo**.  In the labs contained on this site, we will be exploring how to quickly and easily implement Data Protection for Red Hat OpenShift clusters using Kasten K10 by Veeam.

For more information on how to deploy, configure, and manage Kasten K10, visit our [Documentation Portal](https://docs.kasten.io) or [try fully featured Kasten K10 today for free](https://www.kasten.io/free-kubernetes)!

These labs are written with the assumption that you have an existing RedHat OpenShift cluster deployed along with the [Kasten K10 Operator](https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/products/kasten-k10).  If you are a RedHat employee, you can deploy the required infrastructure by visiting [demo.redhat.com](https://demo.redhat.com).
